# Q. How does each recursive call diminish the size of the problem?

# A. Recursion reduces the space occupied by multiple instance of the same code sequence executed during the instruamount of code that runs mulitiple times during

# Q. What instance of the problem space can serve as the base case?

# A. 

# Q. Will this solution always reach the base case? If not, explain why.

# A. 

# Q. What change can be made to make the solution correct?

# A. 

# a, b = map(int, input().split())
# print("This is",a)
# print("This is",b)
